Prompt engineering is a process in natural language processing where the input prompt or instruction is carefully crafted to guide the behavior of a language model. 
It involves designing specific cues, instructions, or contextual information to elicit desired responses. 
Effective prompt engineering can enhance the model's performance, control output, and improve the overall quality and relevance of generated text.
